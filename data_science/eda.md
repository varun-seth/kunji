# Exploratory Data Analysis

- Data staging and clean up: This is the basic data cleanup and preparation stage. You collect the data from various sources, clean it and prepare the master dataset.
- Sanity checks: The next step is doing a quick sanity check of the entire dataset to observe any unusual data points that should not exist.
- Univariate Analysis: Finally we begin with the univariate analysis part. This is where visualization tools like histograms and boxplots come in handy as they help in analyzing numerical features. 
- Bivariate Analysis: Then, you go ahead and evaluate the relationship between the target variable and the rest of the features. Here plots like scatter plots, pair plots, correlation matrices come in very handy to do the analysis. Some segmented analysis can also be done in this step as well.
- Hypotheses validation: In this step, you'll be getting some directional insights on whether the hypotheses that you built earlier are showing any promise or not.
Feature Engineering: Finally, if you want, you can do feature engineering to extract useful insights from the given dataset.
